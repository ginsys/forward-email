# Forward Email CLI Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

**Competitive Advantage**: Forward Email has **zero official CLI tools** despite a comprehensive API with 20+ endpoints. This represents a significant first-mover advantage opportunity.

**Target Market**:
- DevOps engineers automating email infrastructure
- Developers integrating email into CI/CD pipelines  
- Enterprise teams needing audit trails and compliance
- Cost-conscious users ($3/month with full API access)

## 🚀 Current Status

**Phase**: 1.1 Core Infrastructure → **COMPLETED** ✅  
**Next**: Phase 1.2 Domain Operations → **IN PROGRESS** 🔄  
**Progress**: Authentication system fully implemented with comprehensive testing. Ready to build first API operations.

### Recent Achievements
- ✅ **Authentication Foundation**: Complete auth system with keyring integration
- ✅ **Security Framework**: Multi-source credential management (env → keyring → config)  
- ✅ **CLI Commands**: Full auth command suite (`login`, `verify`, `status`, `logout`)
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 24 test cases covering all auth scenarios
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Windows/macOS/Linux keyring support with graceful fallbacks

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1.2)
1. **Domain Data Models**: Define Go structs for Forward Email domain API responses
2. **Domain Service Implementation**: Complete `DomainService` with list, create, get operations
3. **Domain List Command**: Implement `forward-email domain list` with table output
4. **API Integration**: Wire domain service to API client with proper error handling
5. **Basic Testing**: Domain service unit tests and integration tests

### 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements (Phase 1.1)
- **Enhanced Auth Provider** (`pkg/auth/provider.go`): Flexible multi-source credential management
- **Keyring Integration** (`internal/keyring/keyring.go`): Secure OS keyring with 99designs/keyring library  
- **Extended API Client** (`pkg/api/client.go`): Auth validation and enhanced error handling
- **Auth Commands** (`internal/cmd/auth.go`): Complete authentication workflow management
- **Security Model**: Environment variables → OS keyring → config file priority hierarchy
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Secret Service
