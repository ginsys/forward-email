# Forward Email CLI - Project Memory

## üéØ Project Overview

**Forward Email CLI** - A comprehensive command-line interface for managing Forward Email accounts and resources through their public REST API. This project represents a **first-mover advantage** as Forward Email currently has zero official CLI tools.

**Current Phase**: Phase 1.3 Alias & Email Operations ‚Üí **COMPLETED** ‚úÖ  
**Next Phase**: Phase 1.4 Enhanced Features ‚Üí **PLANNED** ‚è≥

## üìã Planning Documents

- **[VERSIONING_RELEASE_PLAN.md](./VERSIONING_RELEASE_PLAN.md)**: Comprehensive strategy for implementing semantic versioning, automated releases, and multi-platform distribution
- **[TASKS.md](./TASKS.md)**: Centralized task management for past, ongoing, and future project work

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles

- **Clean Separation**: SDK (pkg/api) ‚Üí CLI commands (cmd/) ‚Üí User interface  
- **Security First**: OS keyring integration, credential redaction, secure defaults
- **Developer Experience**: Shell completion, interactive wizards, comprehensive help
- **Enterprise Ready**: Multi-profile, audit logging, CI/CD integration

## üìä Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED (100% Functional)

**Phase 1.1 - Core Infrastructure**
- Multi-source authentication with OS keyring integration
- Profile management system for multi-environment workflows
- Cobra CLI framework with structured commands
- Cross-platform support (Linux/macOS/Windows)

**Phase 1.2 - Domain Operations** 
- Complete domain CRUD operations
- DNS record management and verification
- Member management with role-based access
- Multi-format output system (table/JSON/YAML/CSV)

**Phase 1.3 - Alias & Email Management**
- Full alias lifecycle management
- Interactive and programmatic email sending
- Attachment support with content type detection
- Quota monitoring and usage statistics

### ‚è≥ PLANNED (Phase 1.4+ - Enhanced Features)
- Comprehensive test coverage for email services
- Bulk operations for batch processing
- Interactive setup wizards
- Shell completion scripts
- CI/CD release automation

## üîß Key Technical Decisions

- **Framework**: Cobra + Viper for CLI and configuration management
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic with API key, OS keyring priority hierarchy
- **Output**: Multiple formats (table/JSON/YAML/CSV) with stable ordering
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with user-friendly messages
- **Service Architecture**: Complete separation between API client and CLI commands
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests with mock implementations

## üöÄ Forward Email API Integration

### Authentication Method
- **Type**: HTTP Basic Authentication
- **Format**: `Authorization: Basic <base64(api_key + ":")>`
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.forwardemail.net/v1/`

### API Coverage Status
- **Domains**: CRUD operations, DNS/SMTP verification ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Aliases**: Complete lifecycle with recipients and settings ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Emails**: Send operations with attachment support ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Account**: Profile management, quota monitoring (planned)
- **Logs**: Download with rate limit respect (10/day) (planned)

## üìà Competitive Advantage

Forward Email has **zero official CLI tools** despite comprehensive API with 20+ endpoints. This represents a significant first-mover advantage opportunity, especially given:
- Cost-effectiveness: $3/month with full API access
- Developer-aligned values and open-source ecosystem
- Growing demand for CLI automation tools

## üìö Documentation Standards & Maintenance Requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: Documentation Synchronization ‚ö†Ô∏è

**ALL DOCUMENTATION created in this project MUST be kept up-to-date with EVERY changeset:**

#### **Inline Code Documentation**
- **Go Source Files**: All 27 non-test Go files have comprehensive inline documentation
- **Function/Method Comments**: Document purpose, parameters, return values, error conditions
- **Type Documentation**: Struct fields, interfaces, and data models fully documented
- **Package Documentation**: Clear purpose and architecture context for all packages

#### **Project Documentation**
- **User Documentation** (`/docs/`): Quick start, commands, configuration, troubleshooting
- **Developer Documentation** (`/docs/development/`): Architecture, API integration, testing, contributing
- **Package Documentation** (`/pkg/*/README.md`, `/internal/*/README.md`): Usage examples and patterns
- **Claude Memory** (`/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Project status, decisions, implementation details

#### **Documentation Update Requirements**

**MANDATORY**: When making ANY code changes, you MUST:

1. **Update Inline Documentation** if function signatures, behavior, or purpose changes
2. **Update README files** if package interfaces or usage patterns change  
3. **Update User Guides** if CLI commands, flags, or workflows change
4. **Update Architecture Docs** if system design or component relationships change
5. **Update Claude Memory** if implementation status, decisions, or technical approach changes

#### **Quality Gates**

- All PRs must include documentation updates for affected components
- Documentation reviews are required for all code changes
- Inline documentation must be validated with `go doc` commands
- User documentation must be tested with actual CLI usage

**Rationale**: The comprehensive documentation created represents significant investment and provides critical value for:
- Developer onboarding and maintenance efficiency
- User adoption and support reduction  
- Code quality and architectural clarity
- Professional project standards

## üîç Known Limitations & Next Steps

### Current Limitations
- **API Documentation**: Limited Forward Email API docs, reverse-engineering from Auth.js examples
- **Testing Coverage**: Email service tests needed for Phase 1.4
- **Bulk Operations**: No batch processing capabilities yet
- **Template System**: No email template support yet

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1.4)
1. Write comprehensive tests for alias and email services
2. Implement bulk operations for batch processing
3. Create enhanced setup and configuration wizards
4. Add shell completion scripts (Bash/Zsh/Fish)
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated releases
