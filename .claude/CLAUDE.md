# Forward Email CLI Project Memory

## Project Overview
Go-based CLI tool for Forward Email API management with enterprise-grade features and developer-first experience.

## Architecture Principles
- Clean separation: SDK (pkg/api) ï¿½ CLI commands (cmd/) ï¿½ User interface
- Security-first: OS keyring integration, credential redaction, secure defaults
- Developer Experience: Shell completion, interactive wizards, comprehensive help
- Enterprise Ready: Multi-profile, audit logging, CI/CD integration

## Current Status
- âœ… Architecture documents: v0.1 (foundation) + v0.2 (enhanced) analyzed
- âœ… Project structure: Complete Go module with pkg/, internal/, cmd/ organization
- âœ… Build system: Makefile with cross-platform builds, CI/CD pipeline configured
- âœ… Documentation: README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, implementation plan established
- âœ… Core framework: Cobra CLI, Viper config, basic API client foundation
- ðŸŽ¯ Next: Begin Phase 1 Week 1 - Authentication system and domain operations
- Target: Go 1.21+, cross-platform (Linux/macOS/Windows)

## Key Technical Decisions
- Framework: Cobra + Viper for CLI and configuration
- Authentication: HTTP Basic with API key, OS keyring for secure storage
- Output: Multiple formats (table/JSON/YAML/CSV) with stable ordering
- Caching: 5-minute TTL for API responses, 1-hour auth sessions
- Error Handling: Structured errors with actionable suggestions

## Development Phases
1. Foundation (Weeks 1-4): Core auth, CRUD operations, basic output
2. Enhancement (Weeks 5-8): Bulk ops, templates, interactive features  
3. Ecosystem (Weeks 9-12): CI/CD, plugins, documentation
4. Enterprise (Weeks 13-16): Advanced security, compliance, automation

## Competitive Advantage
Forward Email has **zero official CLI tools** despite comprehensive API. First-mover advantage with $3/month cost-effectiveness and developer-aligned values.

## Implementation Plan
See [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed 16-week development roadmap with phases:
1. Foundation (Weeks 1-4): Core functionality and architecture
2. Enhancement (Weeks 5-8): Professional features and developer experience  
3. Ecosystem (Weeks 9-12): Community integration and plugin system
4. Enterprise (Weeks 13-16): Advanced features and automation
